Generating HTML test reports in Cypress for a monorepo project that contains multiple app folders involves configuring Cypress to handle multiple applications and generate reports in the desired format. Here's a step-by-step guide:
### Step 1: Install Required Packages
Ensure you have Cypress and the required reporter installed in your project. You’ll need the **Cypress-Mochawesome-Reporter** for generating HTML reports.
```bash
npm install cypress mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator --save-dev
```
### Step 2: Configure Cypress to Use Mochawesome Reporter
1. In your `cypress.json` (or `cypress.config.js` if you're using Cypress 10+), you can specify the reporter configuration.
#### Example `cypress.json`:
```json
{
  "reporter": "mochawesome",
  "reporterOptions": {
    "reportDir": "cypress/reports/mochawesome-report",
    "overwrite": false,
    "html": true,
    "json": true
  }
}
```
This will generate reports in the `cypress/reports/mochawesome-report` directory.
### Step 3: Update the `package.json` to Generate HTML Reports for Multiple Apps
If your monorepo contains multiple applications in different folders (e.g., `app1`, `app2`, `app3`), you’ll need to make sure each app can generate its own reports. You can use a script to run tests for each app and merge the results.
In the `scripts` section of your `package.json`, add the following:
#### Example `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:app1": "cypress run --project ./apps/app1",
    "test:app2": "cypress run --project ./apps/app2",
    "test:app3": "cypress run --project ./apps/app3",
    "test:all": "npm run test:app1 && npm run test:app2 && npm run test:app3",
    "merge-reports": "mochawesome-merge cypress/reports/mochawesome-report/*.json > cypress/reports/mochawesome-report/merged.json",
    "generate-report": "marge cypress/reports/mochawesome-report/merged.json"
  }
}
```
This setup allows you to run tests for each app individually (like `npm run test:app1`), merge the reports from all apps (`npm run merge-reports`), and then generate a final HTML report (`npm run generate-report`).
### Step 4: Running Tests and Generating the Report
1. First, run the tests for each app:
   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```
   This will execute the tests for `app1`, `app2`, and `app3` individually.
2. After the tests are done, merge the JSON files:
   ```bash
   npm run merge-reports
   ```
3. Finally, generate the final HTML report:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-report
   ```
The final HTML report will be available in the `cypress/reports/mochawesome-report` directory.
### Step 5: View the Report
Once the report is generated, you can open it in any browser to view the detailed test results.
### Optional: Customize for Your Specific Setup
- If your monorepo is using a specific folder structure, you might need to adjust the `--project` flag in the scripts to point to the correct paths.
- If you're using a different CI/CD setup, ensure that the report generation is integrated into the pipeline so you can view the HTML reports after each test run.
---
This setup allows you to run tests across multiple apps in your monorepo and consolidate the results into a single HTML report using Mochawesome.

//............. SECOND APPROACH....................
Got it! Since your monorepo has multiple journal sites, each with its own Cypress configuration and end-to-end tests in separate folders, the approach will involve running Cypress tests separately for each journal site and then generating the test reports for each of them.
Here’s an adapted approach to cater to your monorepo structure:
### Assumed Folder Structure:
Let's assume your monorepo structure looks like this:
```
/monorepo
  /journal-1
    /cypress
      /e2e
      /config
    /src
  /journal-2
    /cypress
      /e2e
      /config
    /src
  /journal-3
    /cypress
      /e2e
      /config
    /src
  /node_modules
  /package.json
```
Each `journal-x` has its own Cypress configuration and tests in the `cypress/e2e` folder.
### Step-by-Step Guide:
#### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Install Cypress, Mochawesome, and the necessary packages if not already installed:
```bash
npm install cypress mochawesome mochawesome-merge mochawesome-report-generator --save-dev
```
#### Step 2: Configure Cypress for Each Journal Site
For each journal site (`journal-1`, `journal-2`, `journal-3`, etc.), ensure there is a Cypress configuration file (`cypress.json` or `cypress.config.js`) in the `cypress` folder inside each journal's directory.
##### Example `journal-1/cypress.json`:
```json
{
  "reporter": "mochawesome",
  "reporterOptions": {
    "reportDir": "cypress/reports/mochawesome-report",
    "overwrite": false,
    "html": true,
    "json": true
  }
}
```
#### Step 3: Define Custom Scripts in `package.json`
Modify the `package.json` file in the root of your monorepo to add custom scripts for each journal site. This will allow you to run tests for each journal and then generate the HTML reports.
##### Example `package.json` in the root of the monorepo:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:journal-1": "cypress run --project ./journal-1/cypress",
    "test:journal-2": "cypress run --project ./journal-2/cypress",
    "test:journal-3": "cypress run --project ./journal-3/cypress",
    "test:all": "npm run test:journal-1 && npm run test:journal-2 && npm run test:journal-3",
    "merge-reports": "mochawesome-merge ./journal-1/cypress/reports/mochawesome-report/*.json ./journal-2/cypress/reports/mochawesome-report/*.json ./journal-3/cypress/reports/mochawesome-report/*.json > ./cypress/reports/merged.json",
    "generate-report": "marge ./cypress/reports/merged.json"
  }
}
```
### Explanation:
- **`test:journal-1`**, **`test:journal-2`**, **`test:journal-3`**: Runs Cypress tests for each journal site separately.
- **`test:all`**: Runs tests for all journals (you can run this if you want to test everything at once).
- **`merge-reports`**: Merges the test results (in JSON format) from all journal sites into a single file (`merged.json`).
- **`generate-report`**: Generates the final HTML report from the merged JSON data.
#### Step 4: Running the Tests
1. **Run the tests for all journals:**
   To run all tests for all journals at once, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```
2. **Alternatively, run tests for individual journals:**
   For `journal-1`:
   ```bash
   npm run test:journal-1
   ```
   For `journal-2`:
   ```bash
   npm run test:journal-2
   ```
   For `journal-3`:
   ```bash
   npm run test:journal-3
   ```
#### Step 5: Merging and Generating the Report
After running the tests, you need to merge the test results and generate the final HTML report.
1. **Merge the reports** from all journals:
   ```bash
   npm run merge-reports
   ```
2. **Generate the HTML report** from the merged JSON:
   ```bash
   npm run generate-report
   ```
The final HTML report will be generated in the `cypress/reports` folder (you can customize this path as needed).
### Step 6: Viewing the Report
After generating the report, you can open the `merged-report.html` file in any browser to view the consolidated test results for all your journal sites.
---
### Optional: CI/CD Integration
If you're using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI), you can add these steps to your pipeline configuration to run tests for each journal site and generate the report after each build.
For example, in a **GitHub Actions** workflow:
```yaml
name: Cypress Tests for Monorepo
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  cypress:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Cypress tests
        run: npm run test:all
      - name: Merge and generate report
        run: |
          npm run merge-reports
          npm run generate-report
```
---
This setup will allow you to run tests for each journal site independently, merge the results, and generate a single HTML report for all journals in your monorepo.


// .......................THIRD APPROACH........................
For integrating this Cypress testing and report generation process into a CI/CD pipeline, the goal is to ensure that your tests run automatically whenever there's a push to your repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, etc.), and the test results (including HTML reports) are properly generated and accessible.
Here’s an overview of how to integrate this into a CI/CD pipeline using a few common CI tools. I'll use **GitHub Actions** as an example, but the concepts apply to other CI tools too.
---
### CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions (Example)
#### Step 1: Set Up Your GitHub Actions Workflow
In the root of your monorepo, create a `.github/workflows/cypress-tests.yml` file. This file will define the steps for running the tests, merging the reports, and generating the HTML report.
Here's an example GitHub Actions workflow configuration:
```yaml
name: Run Cypress Tests and Generate Reports
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main    # Run tests when code is pushed to the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main    # Also run tests on pull requests targeting the main branch
jobs:
  cypress:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out the repository
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # Step 2: Set up Node.js (set the version based on your project requirements)
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'  # Adjust to the Node.js version you are using
    # Step 3: Install dependencies
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    # Step 4: Run tests for all journals
    - name: Run Cypress tests
      run: npm run test:all
    # Step 5: Merge Mochawesome reports
    - name: Merge Mochawesome reports
      run: npm run merge-reports
    # Step 6: Generate final HTML report
    - name: Generate Mochawesome HTML report
      run: npm run generate-report
    # Step 7: Upload the HTML report as an artifact (optional)
    - name: Upload Cypress report as artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: cypress-report
        path: cypress/reports/mochawesome-report/merged.html
```
---
### Explanation of the Steps:
1. **Triggering the Workflow**:
   - The pipeline is triggered whenever there's a push to the `main` branch or a pull request targeting the `main` branch. You can adjust this depending on your branch naming conventions.
2. **Setting up Node.js**:
   - The `actions/setup-node` action is used to install a specific version of Node.js. Make sure the version matches the one your project uses.
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - This step installs the necessary dependencies, including Cypress and Mochawesome.
4. **Running Cypress Tests**:
   - The `npm run test:all` command is used to run the tests for all journal sites, based on the configuration in your `package.json`.
5. **Merging Reports**:
   - The `npm run merge-reports` command merges the individual test reports from all journal sites into one JSON file.
6. **Generating HTML Report**:
   - The `npm run generate-report` command generates a consolidated HTML report from the merged JSON results.
7. **Uploading Report Artifact (Optional)**:
   - This step uploads the generated `merged.html` report as an artifact in GitHub Actions. You can access this file later from the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.
---
### Step 2: Accessing the Test Reports
After the CI/CD pipeline runs, you’ll be able to access the test reports in the following ways:
1. **GitHub Actions Artifacts**:
   - If you uploaded the report as an artifact (like in the last step above), you can download the HTML report directly from the **Artifacts** section of the GitHub Actions job summary.
   - After the job completes, navigate to the GitHub Actions workflow run, scroll down to **Artifacts**, and download the `cypress-report` file.
2. **Custom Report Location**:
   - You can also modify the pipeline to publish the HTML report to a custom location, such as a file server or a cloud storage service (AWS S3, for example), depending on your needs.
---
### Step 3: GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you'd like to automatically deploy the HTML test report to a web page after each CI run, you can use **GitHub Pages** to serve the report.
#### Example of Deploying to GitHub Pages:
Add these steps to your `cypress-tests.yml`:
```yaml
    # Step 8: Deploy the HTML report to GitHub Pages (Optional)
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        folder: cypress/reports/mochawesome-report
```
This step will deploy the generated `merged.html` to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository, making it accessible as a public webpage. You can access the HTML report by visiting the `gh-pages` branch URL.
---
### Step 4: Example with GitLab CI/CD
If you're using **GitLab CI/CD**, the pipeline configuration would look like this:
```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - report
test:
  stage: test
  image: cypress/included:10.0.0  # Use Cypress's official Docker image
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run test:all
merge_reports:
  stage: report
  script:
    - npm run merge-reports
    - npm run generate-report
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - cypress/reports/mochawesome-report/merged.html
    expire_in: 1 week
```
In this case, the report will be uploaded as an artifact after the `merge_reports` job, and you can download it from the GitLab pipeline job page.
---
### Step 5: Monitoring and Notifications
To make your CI/CD process more robust, you may also want to:
1. **Integrate Notifications**:
   - Configure notifications to alert you or your team when the tests pass/fail (via Slack, email, or other services).
2. **Fail Fast**:
   - Consider adding a "fail-fast" strategy for your CI pipeline, meaning that if one journal's tests fail, the entire pipeline stops, saving time and resources.
---
### Recap
- **GitHub Actions (or other CI tools)** automates your Cypress testing and report generation process.
- **CI Pipeline** triggers when changes are pushed to the repository and generates a consolidated report for all journals.
- **Mochawesome** generates detailed HTML and JSON reports.
- **Artifacts** (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) allow you to download or view the test reports after each run.
- **Optional Deployment**: Use **GitHub Pages** or other hosting methods to serve the generated HTML reports publicly or privately.
This approach ensures that your tests run automatically on each push, and you have access to the results in a centralized location (e.g., GitHub Artifacts, GitHub Pages).
